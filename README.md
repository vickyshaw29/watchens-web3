# Watchen
I have created this application named watchen  using React with typescript , mui , moralis api and ethers js. I have configured the app using atomic  structure which is perhaps the best folder structure as of now. The benefit of using this is It will be highly scalable :)
## Features
- Connect wallet with Metamask & Wallet Connect  
- Dashboard with all the nfts
- Exact implementation of the given UI/UX in the Figma file
- Reverse resolve ENS means If the user has END it will show that else It will show wallet address
- Cross platform
